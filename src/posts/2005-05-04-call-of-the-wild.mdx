I had enough fun doing the last deckbuilding exercise that I felt I should do more. I'll probably do one every so often from now on. This time around I'll be basing it around a bad rare. I'll be following the same format and even using the same test decks as last time.

<Card>Call of the Wild</Card> has been around for quite sometime and has never been good. We'll try and fix that. Or at least have some fun with it.

## Brainstorming:



Obviously big expensive creatures you'd like to drop straight into play are nice with the card so we'll list a few of those first. Rather than listing every fatty I can think of I'm only going straight for the best this time around.

<CardList counts={false} columns={true}>
Darksteel Colossus
Triskelion
Sundering Titan
Akroma, Angel of Wrath
Reya Dawnbringer
Crater Hellion
Petradon
Butcher Orgg
Shivan Hellkite
Rorix Bladewing
Tidal Kraken
Quicksilver dragon
Mahamoti Djinn
Visara the Dreadful
Avatar of Woe
Spirit of the Night
Thorn Elemental
Verdant Force
Silvos, Rogue Elemental
Plated Slagwurm
Deranged Hermit
Sliver Queen
Rith, the Awakener
</CardList>


In addition to fatties it may be nice to try a couple of utility creatures as well. Here are some of the better ones.

<CardList counts={false} columns={true}>
Duplicant
Solemn Simulacrum
Cloudchaser Eagle
Staunch Defenders
Flametongue Kavu
Ghitu Slinger
Avalanche Riders
Man-O'-War
Nekrataal
Bone Shredder
Ravenous Rats
Viridian Shaman
Wall of Blossoms
Eternal Witness
Mystic Snake
</CardList>


Now here are some ways of controlling what the top card of your library is.

<CardList counts={false} columns={true}>
Scroll Rack
Sensei's Divining Top
Enlightened Tutor
Goblin Spy
Magma Jet
Future Sight
Brainstorm
Serum Visions
Soothsaying
Haunted Crossroads
Mortuary
Volrath's Stronghold
Lose Hope
Worldly Tutor
Sylvan Library
Reclaim
</CardList>

There are two options that interest me. One is using Haunted Crossroads to reuse utility creatures every turn. This would need to use creatures that had sacrificed abilities in order to get them into the graveyard. While this sounds like a fine idea it is pretty much the same thing I did with the Shirei deck. The other thing that got my attention is Scroll Rack. With this you wouldn't have to worry about the color of the creature or if you could ever cast it. This means fatties and lots of them.



## Rough Decklist:


<Deck title="Call of the Wild">
<CardList title="Lands">
*4 Brushland
*4 Windswept Heath
*3 Plains
*13 Forest
</CardList>
<CardList title="Creatures">
*4 Sakura-Tribe Elder
*1 Sundering Titan
*1 Triskelion
*1 Akroma, Angel of Wrath
*1 Darksteel Colossus
*4 Solemn Simulacrum
*1 Rorix Bladewing
*1 Verdant Force
*1 Avatar of Woe
*1 Crater Hellion
</CardList>
<CardList title="Spells">
*4 Call of the Wild
*4 Scroll Rack
*4 Worldly Tutor
*4 Enlightened Tutor
*4 Naturalize
</CardList>
</Deck>



## After Testing:



The deck is quite terrible without <Card>Call of the Wild</Card> and <Card>Scroll Rack</Card> in play. I would have thought 4 <Card card="Enlightened Tutor">Enlightened Tutors</Card> would be enough to find the Calls but it still doesn't happen until turn 6-7. Since it pretty much just sits there until then some changes are needed. I want to make the deck less reliant on the Calls meaning pulling some of the fat for creatures that are actually castable.



## Final Decklist:


<Deck title="Call of the Wild">
<CardList title="Lands">
*4 Brushland
*4 Windswept Heath
*3 Plains
*13 Forest
</CardList>
<CardList title="Creatures">
*4 Sakura-Tribe Elder
*4 Eternal Witness
*1 Akroma, Angel of Wrath
*1 Darksteel Colossus
*4 Wall of Blossoms
*4 Solemn Simulacrum
</CardList>
<CardList title="Spells">
*4 Call of the Wild
*4 Scroll Rack
*4 Worldly Tutor
*4 Enlightened Tutor
*2 Naturalize
</CardList>
</Deck>

The deck is able to function more without the Call in play. It now actually has a chance to get going. However once its going it isn't as powerful as it was. I think it is a fair trade and is about as good as the deck is going to get.
